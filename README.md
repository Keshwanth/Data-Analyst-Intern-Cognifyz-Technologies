# Cognifyz Technologies Restaurant Analysis

This Jupyter notebook showcases a comprehensive restaurant dataset analysis completed as a Data Analysis Intern task for Cognifyz Technologies. It analyzes a dataset of global restaurants covering cuisines, ratings, pricing, and locations using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.[1]

## Key Features

- **Dataset Overview**: Examines restaurant data with 21 columns including Restaurant ID, Name, City, Cuisines, Price Range, Aggregate Rating, and Votes from multiple countries.[1]
- **Level 1 Analysis**:
  - Top cuisines: North Indian (41.46%), Chinese (28.64%), Fast Food (20.79%).[1]
  - City insights: New Delhi has the most restaurants; Inner City leads with highest average rating (4.9).[1]
  - Price range distribution visualized via bar chart with percentages per category.[1]
- **Level 2 & 3 Analysis**: Chain performance (e.g., Barbeque Nation top-rated), review keyword extraction (excellent, good, average), and review length vs. rating correlation.[1]

## Technologies Used

- Python 3 with Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- ydata-profiling for exploratory analysis
- NLTK for text processing (stopwords, keyword counts)

## Installation & Run

1. Clone the repository and open `CognifyzTech.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install ydata-profiling pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib nltk`.
3. Upload `Dataset.csv` (restaurant data) to match notebook paths.
4. Run cells sequentially for analysis and visualizations.[1]

## Results Summary

| Analysis | Key Finding |
|----------|-------------|
| Top City by Count | New Delhi[1] |
| Highest Avg Rating City | Inner City (4.9)[1] |
| Top Chains by Votes | Barbeque Nation (28,142 votes, 4.35 avg)[1] |
| Common Review Words | Average (3,737), Good (3,179), Excellent (301)[1] |

This project demonstrates data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and insights extraction skills relevant for data analytics roles.
